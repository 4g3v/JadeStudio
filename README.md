# JadeStudio

JadeStudio is a wip (currently not in progress) tool that allows you to work with Beyond Good and Evil's files.

## Features
Currently you can extract and rebuild BIG files (sally_clean.bf) which means you can change files in the game.

There is support for extracting and rebuilding texture files (ff8*.bin) although not every texture type is supported right now.

There's also a text editor which allows you to look at and change all of the text in the game.

## Thanks to
